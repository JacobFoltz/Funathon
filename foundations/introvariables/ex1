The foundation upon which algebra is built is variables. A variable is a number that we do not know represented by a letter. While letters may seem out of place or complicated in math, the idea is really not that complicated. In math, letters follow every concept that numbers follow. We need variables because we need functions that we can pick different numbers for. In a function, there is an input and an output. The input is usually called "x", and the output is referred to as "y" For example, in this example, x = the total number of cookies, and. However, let's pretend an authority figure has limited us to only eating half the cookies. So, when you have x amount of cookies, you can get y amount of cookies in return. This function can be represented by y = 1/2x.
