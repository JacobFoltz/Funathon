In math, equations can be written in many different forms. Just like in real life how we have synonyms, math has something similar called equivalent expressions. Equivalent expressions are written differently, but they have the same value. For example, 3x + 4x = 7x. Our goal is to reduce these equations to their smallest form possible. So, instead of writing 3x + 4x, we can just write 7x.

The main thing to remember when reducing or simplifying the expression is that like terms go together. 5x + 3x = 8x, but 5 + 3 =8. Finally, 5x + 3 simply equals 5x + 3.

This rule is essentially the same during multiplication, but it looks different. For example, take 5 times 5x. We multiply 5 by the coefficient of x, which is 5, to get 25x.

At the same time, you should always remember to multiply across the parenthesis. For example, 5(3x+4) equals 15x+20. Make sure you multiply the outside number across everything in the parenthesis. While this may seem easy, many students lose points over forgetting this exact step.

Finally, you need to use the order of operations or PEMDAS. PEMDAS is how math is done. In equation 6(5+1), how do you know what to do first? This problem is exactly what PEMDAS helps to solve. Check out this dropdown menu below to see how you can solve math problems in the correct order.



Now, let's test your knowledge of PEMDAS. Answer these questions below to test your knowledge.

What is the first step of simplifying this problem: 4x+6-4(3x+2)

Adding 3x and 2 to get 5x

Subtract 4 from 6 to get 2

Multiply -4 across 3x+2 to get -12x-8

Add 4x + 6 to get 10

Answer: Multiply -4 across 3x+2 to get -12x-8 Explanation: Although parenthesis comes first in PEMDAS, since 3x and 2 are not alike terms, we skip parenthesis and go to multiplication. So, we multiply what is in the parenthesis by -4.


What is the next step in simplifying this problem: 4x+6-12x+8 

Adding 4x and 6 to get 10x

Adding 4x and 6 to get 10

Adding 4x and 8 to get 12x

Subtracting 12x from 4x to get -8x

Answer: Subtracting 12x from 4x to get -8x Explanation: We look for the first like terms to combine which is 12 and -4x.

What is the next step in simplifying this problem:

-8x+6+8

Adding 6 and 8 to get -8x+14

Adding -8x and 6 to get -25x

Adding -8x and 8 to get 0

Adding 6x and 8x to get 14x

Answer: Adding 6 and 8 to get -8x+14 Explanation: We combine the only like terms left.
