In math, just because an expression looks different than another does not mean that it necessarily is different. For example, in real life, 2 groups of 3 cookies are the same as 6 cookies in value. Functions work the same way. For example, 2(4+3x) = 8+6x. Equivalent functions are easy as long as you remember a few key rules. 

1. The first rule to remember is that like terms go together. For example, 3x + 5x = 8x. 5x + 5 = 5x + 5. However, 3 + 5 = 8. The one time we can combine both terms is in multiplication. In multiplication, we can multiply the number by the variable, or the coefficient, by the multiplies. S0, 3 times 6x = 18x. 18x divided by 3 = 6x. 

2. The next rule to remember is to always distribute to all of the numbers. A common mistake is to forget to multiply over all of the numbers. 3(6 + 2x) = 18 + 6x, not 18 + 2x. Every number in the parenthesis must be multiplied by the outside number. Try some examples below.
