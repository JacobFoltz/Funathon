<h3>Introduction to division by 0</h3>

<h2>Part 3</h2>

    <p>Everyone knows that math can seem dumb. However, believe it or not, math is rooted in reality. Division is the act of dividing something into equal parts. So, if we have the number 18 and we divide it by 6, we split 18 into equal groups of 6, which leaves us with 3 groups. Hince, 18 divided by 6 is 3. However, what happens if we try to divide by 0? In real life, we cannot split 18 into 0 groups because we still have 18, so math pretty much bans division by 0. We call any division by 0 "undefined".</p>
