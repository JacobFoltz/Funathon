<h3>Introduction to division by 0</h3>

<h2>Part 2</h2>

    <p>The function of division in math is fairly simple. The most basic way to describe division is how many of something will go into something. For example, 6 will go into 18 3 times. However, a concept that is critical to understanding Algebra is division by zero. How many times can nothing go into something? The answer is fairly simple. You can't. While you may think the answer is infinite, what you need to understand is that nothing simply cannot go into something. Therefore, we call any number divided by 0 undefined. So, any time you see something divided by 0, you should immediately remember that that number is known as undefined.</p>
