                <p>
             Here at Matheasy, our goal is to give students an extra boost of help in their attempts to learn Algebra 1. 
             <br>
             From our experiences as students, we learned that students jumping into Algebra for their first time may find it incredibly difficult to learn with just the teaching of their teachers, so we created a website intending to add a little more explanation and practice to whatever a student may be learning from his or her teacher to hopefully promote an easier learning experience for the student.
